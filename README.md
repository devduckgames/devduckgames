**`Software Engineer / Consultant / Game Developer / Creator`**

In the early morning, I'm a hobbyist game developer with three published games and YouTube creator with 175k+ subscribers. During the day I'm a software engineer and consultant, focusing on native and hybrid mobile app development and XR development across a variety of platforms. Throughout the entire day, I'm wishing there were more hours in the day.

I started the [DevDuck](youtube.com/devduck) YouTube channel in 2019 to help keep myself accountable to (finally) finish a game development project. Throughout the years I've continued to post development logs that follow my process building and releasing games as a hobby balanced alongside a full-time job.
